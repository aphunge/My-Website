            <p> 
                My first decision in my career was to accept a position at TQL.  
                I feel excited committing my time to learning how one facilitates
                 companies’ procurement and transportation processes as well as negotiating 
                 with companies. TQL is a 3PL or third-party logistics provider that prides 
                 itself on customer service and the ability to fulfill our customers’ needs 
                 consistently no matter the time. We, TQL, are open 24/7/365 which means we 
                 are always on call to ensure transportation goes smoothly. If an accident 
                 occurs it is our duty to communicate with our customers what we are doing 
                 to actively solve the problem to cater to their operations. I am very 
                 excited to begin my career at TQL and contribute my skills.
